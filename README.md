# Learn-intermediate-python3
In this project, we will be using some of the advanced containers in Python to command, track, and score simple robots which are trying to traverse different mazes. Your job will be to fill in the missing code from the robot_race.py file. A lot of background code has been provided in the robot_race_functions.py file which we will be using, but the primary focus of this project is to use advanced collections in a meaningful way.
The mazes are csv files which contain different characters that represent different objects in the robot race. Any letter represents a robot, the # character represents a wall which the robots can collide with, and the $ is the goal which the robots are racing towards. Robots can traverse into any empty space (shown by an _) and they can even occupy the same space as another robot (shown as a +). 
At any point during this project, feel free to create your own csv maze and use it in the code instead of the example ones.
